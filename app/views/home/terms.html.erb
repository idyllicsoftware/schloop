      <b><em>Privacy</em></b>
      <br>
      <p style="font-weight: normal">
        Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://schloop.co/privacy_policy"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>
        to make important disclosures about how you can use SCHLOOP to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://schloop.co/privacy_policy"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>
        , and to use it to make informed decisions.

      <b><em>Sharing your content and information</em></b>
      <br>
      <p style="font-weight: normal">
        We own all of the content and information you post on SCHLOOP, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. 
        <br>
        In addition: 
        <ol type="i" style="font-weight: normal">
          <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with SCHLOOP (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. 
          </li>
          <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
          </li>

          <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://schloop.co/privacy_policy"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>

          </li>

          <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people of SCHLOOP, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
          </li>

          <li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about SCHLOOP, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
